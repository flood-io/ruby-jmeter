Tired of using the JMeter GUI or looking at hairy XML files?

This gem lets you write test plans for JMeter in your favourite text editor, and optionally run them on [flood.io](http://flood.io).

![](https://flood.io/images/logo-flood-medium.png)

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby-jmeter

## Basic Usage

*RubyJmeter* exposes easy-to-use domain specific language for fluent communication with [JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/).It also includes API integration with [flood.io](https://flood.io), a cloud based load testing service.

To use the DSL, first let's require the gem:

```ruby
require 'ruby-jmeter'
```

### Basic Example
Let's create a `test` and save the related `jmx` testplan to file, so we can edit/view it in JMeter.

```ruby
test do
  threads count: 10 do
    visit name: 'Google Search', url: 'http://google.com'
  end
end.jmx
```

So in this example, we just created a test plan, with 10 threads, each of which visited the search page at Google.

### Generating a JMeter Test Plan (JMX)
Note also how we called the `jmx` method of the test. Calling this method will write the contents of the JMeter test plan to file like this.

```
$ ruby testplan.rb
[2013-04-23T10:29:03.275743 #42060]  INFO -- : Test plan saved to: jmeter.jmx
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jmeterTestPlan version="1.2" properties="2.1">
  <hashTree>
    <TestPlan guiclass="TestPlanGui" testclass="TestPlan" testname="Test Plan" enabled="true">
      ...
    </TestPlan>
  </hashTree>
</jmeterTestPlan>
JMX saved to: jmeter.jmx
```

The file that is created can then be executed in the JMeter GUI. If you want to create the file with a different filename and/or path, just add the `file` parameter to the `jmx` method call like this.

```ruby
test do
  threads count: 10 do
    visit name: 'Google Search', url: 'http://google.com'
  end
end.jmx(file: "/tmp/my_testplan.jmx")
```

Windows users should specify a path like this.

```ruby
.jmx(file: "C:\\TEMP\\MyTestplan.jmx")
```

### Running a JMeter Test Plan locally
You can execute the JMeter test plan by calling the `run` method of the test like this.

```ruby
test do
  threads count: 10 do
    visit name: 'Google Search', url: 'http://google.com'
  end
end.run
```

This will launch JMeter in headless (non-GUI mode) and execute the test plan. This is useful for shaking out the script before you push it to the Grid. There are a few parameters that you can set such as the `path` to the JMeter binary, the `file` path/name for the JMX file, the `log` path/name to output JMeter logs, the `jtl` path/name for JMeter results like this, and the `properties` path/name for the additional JMeter property file.

```ruby
test do
  threads count: 10 do
    visit name: 'Google Search', url: 'http://google.com'
  end
end.run(
  path: '/usr/share/jmeter/bin/',
  file: 'jmeter.jmx',
  log: 'jmeter.log',
  jtl: 'results.jtl',
  properties: 'jmeter.properties')
```

### Running a JMeter Test Plan on Flood IO

You can also execute JMeter test plans on Flood IO using our API. To do so, you require an account and API token. If you don't know your token, sign in to [flood.io](https://flood.io/) and check your account settings.

To execute the test on Flood IO, call the `flood` method on the test and pass it the API token like this.

```ruby
test do
  threads count: 10 do
    visit name: 'Google Search', url: 'http://google.com'
  end
end.flood(
  ENV['FLOOD_API_TOKEN'],
  name: 'Demo',
  privacy: 'public',
  ## Select a grid or region to distribute this flood to
  # grid: 'pmmi24XaSMnKjGVEtutroQ',
  # region: 'ap-southeast-2'
)
```

This will then provide you with a link to the live test results on Flood IO like this.

```
I, [2015-02-24T11:15:25.669029 #14010]  INFO -- : Flood results at: https://flood.io/AbRWkFl7VODYCkQuy3ffvA
```

Note you will need to provide a `grid` or `region` parameter to the `.flood` method to describe which grid to distribute the flood test to. Otherwise it will default to the shared grid. You can find the Grid ID from the URL of the target grid in your [grids](https://flood.io/dashboard/grids) dashboard e.g.:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/flood-io-support/Flood_IO_2015-02-24_11-43-21.jpg)

Flood IO provides a shared grid for free, suitable for 5 minute tests, check your dashboard for the latest grid:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/flood-io-support/Flood_IO_2015-02-24_11-44-29.jpg)

Alternatively upgrade to a paid subscription on Flood IO and start your own grids on demand.

### Upload test file via rsync

You can upload the JMeter test plan to remote server by calling the `rsync` method of the test like this.

```ruby
test do
  threads count: 10 do
    visit name: 'Google Search', url: 'http://google.com'
  end
end.rsync(
  remote_host: 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx',
  remote_user: 'user',
  remote_path: '/path/to/remote',
  rsync_bin_path: '/usr/bin/rsync',
  rsync_params: '-az -e "ssh -i /path/to/key.pem"',
  file: './jmx/' + File.basename(__FILE__, ".rb") + '.jmx',
  debug: true
)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Blocks

Each of the methods take an optional block delimited by `do` and `end` or braces `{}`

Blocks let you nest methods within methods, so you can scope the execution of methods as you would in a normal JMeter test plan. For example.

```ruby
test do
  threads count: 100 do
    visit name: 'Home', url: 'http://altentee.com' do
      extract regex: "content='(.+?)' name='csrf-token'", name: 'csrf-token'
    end
  end
end
```

This would create a new test plan, with a 100 user thread group, each user visiting the "Home" page and extracting the CSRF token from the response of each visit.

All methods are nestable, but you should only have one test method, and typically only one threads method. For example, it wouldn't make sense to have a test plan within a test plan, or a thread group within a thread group. You can have multiple thread groups per test plan though. This implies *some* knowlege of how JMeter works.

All methods take a parameter hash to configure related options.

### Threads

You can use the `threads` method to define a group of users:

```ruby
threads count: 100
threads count: 100, continue_forever: true
threads count: 100, loops: 10
threads count: 100, rampup: 30, duration: 60
threads count: 100, scheduler: true,
  start_time: Time.now.to_i * 1000,
  end_time:   (Time.now.to_i * 1000) + (3600 * 1000)
```

### Cookies

You can use the `cookies` method to define a Cookie Manager:

```ruby
test do
  cookies
end
```

This methods takes an optional parameters hash. This is based on the [HTTP Cookie Manager](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#HTTP_Cookie_Manager).

```ruby
test do
  cookies clear_each_iteration: false
end

test do
  cookies policy: 'rfc2109', clear_each_iteration: true
end
```

### Cache

You can use the `cache` method to define a Cache Manager:

```ruby
test do
  cache
end
```

This methods takes an optional parameters hash. This is based on the [HTTP Cache Manager](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#HTTP_Cache_Manager).

```ruby
test do
  cache clear_each_iteration: false
end

test do
  cache use_expires: true, clear_each_iteration: true
end
```

### Authorization

You can use the `auth` method to define an Authorization Manager:

```ruby
test do
  auth
end
```

This methods takes an optional parameters hash. This is based on the [HTTP Authorization Manager](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#HTTP_Authorization_Manager).

```ruby
test do
  auth url: '/', username: 'tim', password: 'secret', domain: 'altentee.com'
end
```

### Navigating

You can use the `visit` method to navigate to pages:

```ruby
visit name: 'Google Search', url: 'http://google.com'
visit name: 'Google Search', url: 'http://google.com'
visit name: 'Google Search', url: 'http://google.com',
  method: 'POST',
  'DO_MULTIPART_POST': 'true'
visit name: 'Google Search', url: 'http://google.com',
  use_keepalive: 'false'
visit name: 'Google Search', url: 'http://google.com',
  connect_timeout: '1000',
  response_timeout: '60000'
visit name: 'View Login', url: '/login',
  protocol: "https",
  port: 443
```

### Submitting a Form

You can use the `submit` method to POST a HTTP form:

```ruby
submit name: 'Submit Form', url: 'http://altentee.com/',
  fill_in: {
    username: 'tim',
    password: 'password',
    'csrf-token' => '${csrf-token}'
  }
```

This method makes a single request. The fill_in parameter lets you specify key/value pairs for form field parameters. You can also use the built in JMeter `${expression}` language to access run time variables extracted from previous responses.

### POST JSON

```ruby
  header [
    { name: 'Content-Type', value: 'application/json' }
  ]

  person = { name: "Tom" }

  post name: 'Create Person',
        url: "https://example.com/people.json",
        raw_body: person.to_json do
        with_xhr
      end
```

### Think Time

You can use the `think_time` method to insert pauses into the simulation. This method is aliased as `random_timer`.

```ruby
think_time 3000
```

This method takes 2 parameters: the constant delay, and an optional variable delay. Both are specified in milliseconds. This is based on the [Gaussian Random Timer](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Gaussian_Random_Timer). This timer pauses each thread request for a random amount of time, with most of the time intervals ocurring near a particular value. The total delay is the sum of the Gaussian distributed value (with mean 0.0 and standard deviation 1.0) times the deviation value you specify, and the offset value.

```ruby
# constant delay of 3 seconds
think_time 3000
# constant delay of 1 seconds with variance up to 6 seconds.
random_timer 1000, 6000
```

### Response Extractor

You can use the `extract` method to extract values from a server response using a regular expression. This is aliased as the `web_reg_save_param` method. This method is typically used inside a `visit` or `submit` block.

```ruby
extract regex: "content='(.+?)' name='csrf-token'", name: 'csrf-token'

visit name: 'Google', url: "http://google.com/" do
  extract regex: 'aria-label="(.+?)"', name: 'button_text'
  extract xpath: '//button', name: 'button'
end
```

This is based on the [Regular Expression Extractor](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Regular_Expression_Extractor) and [XPath Extractor](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#XPath_Extractor)

```ruby
visit name: "Altentee", url: "http://altentee.com" do
  extract regex: "content='(.+?)' name='csrf-token'", name: 'csrf-token'
  extract regex: 'value="(.+?)" name="JESSIONSID"', name: 'JSESSIONID'
  web_reg_save_param regex: 'value="(.+?)" name="VIEWSTATE"', name: 'VIEWSTATE'
  extract name: 'username', regex: 'value="(.+?)", name="username"',
    default: 'Tim Koopmans',
    match_number: 1
  extract name: 'shopping_item', regex: 'id="(.+?)" name="book"',
    match_number: 0 # random
end
```
You can later use the extracted values with subsequent requests:

```ruby
post name: 'Authenticate', url: 'http://example.com/api/authentication/facebook', raw_body: '{"auth_token": "FB_TOKEN"}' do
  extract name: 'auth_token', regex: %q{.*"token":"([^"]+)".*}
  extract name: 'user_id', regex: %q{.*"user_id":([^,]+),.*}
end

header({name: 'X-Auth-Token', value: '${auth_token}'})
visit name: 'User profile', url: 'http://example.com/api/users/${user_id}'
```

### Response Assertion

You can use the `assert` method to extract values from a server response using a regular expression. This is aliased as the `web_reg_find` method. This method is typically used inside a `visit` or `submit` block.

```ruby
visit "Altentee", "http://altentee.com" do
  assert contains: "We test, tune and secure your site"
end
```


This method takes 3 parameters: the matching rule, the test string, and an optional parameters hash. This is based on the [Response Assertion](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Response_Assertion).

```ruby
visit "Altentee", "http://altentee.com" do
  assert "contains": "We test, tune and secure your site"
  assert "not-contains": "We price gouge on cloud services"
  assert "matches": "genius"
  assert "not-matches": "fakers"
  assert "contains": "magic"
  assert "not-contains": "unicorns", scope: 'all'
end
```

### IDL

We use an interface description language (IDL) as a bridge between JMeter's components expressed as XML in a `.jmx` test plan to Ruby's DSL objects in this repository.

To automate this `lib/ruby-jmeter/idl.rb` can be executed from the command line which will read from `lib/ruby-jmeter/idl.xml` and output to `lib/ruby-jmeter/dsl`

For example:

```sh
flood/ruby-jmeter - [master●] » ruby lib/ruby-jmeter/idl.rb
flood/ruby-jmeter - [master●] » git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

  modified:   lib/ruby-jmeter/DSL.md
  modified:   lib/ruby-jmeter/dsl/foreach_controller.rb
  modified:   lib/ruby-jmeter/dsl/http_request.rb

  modified:   lib/ruby-jmeter/dsl/test_fragment.rb
  modified:   lib/ruby-jmeter/dsl/user_parameters.rb
```

You **should never manually update** code in `lib/ruby-jmeter/dsl` as this is automatically overwritten whenever we run the IDL script. As new components / plugins are added, or major versions of JMeter are updated, we open `lib/ruby-jmeter/idl.xml` in the JMeter UI with those updates prior to running the IDL script. This makes updating between versions more easy.

### DSL

Much of the behaviour of the gem is defined in `lib/ruby-jmeter/dsl.rb` which is where you should be updating code. You can extend individual DSL component behaviour in `live/ruby-jmeter/extend/**/*.rb`

### Plugins

Some custom code has been contributed particularly for support of JMeter plugins. These are not included in the IDL and as such should be added to `lib/ruby-jmeter/plugins`. Please follow some of the other examples.

### Bundler

We recommend using the Ruby gem bundle to manage your dependencies. Typical setup would be:


```sh
gem install bundler
cd <your local clone>
bundle install
```

Then you can run any rake / test tasks with the prefix `bundle exec`

### Tests

If contributing please add an appropriate test. See `spec/*_spec.rb` for examples. Tests can be run from the command line as follows:

    $ bundle exec rspec

### Examples

It is often useful to add an appropriate example for other users and for testing your changes locally with the JMeter UI. See `examples` for different types of examples. To let your examples work locally from your own changes / commits simply prefix the examples with:

```ruby
$LOAD_PATH.unshift(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'lib'))
```

    $ flood/ruby-jmeter - [master●] » ruby examples/basic_assertion.rb
      W, [2015-10-17T19:31:12.021004 #33216]  WARN -- : Test executing locally ...

Note: most of the examples assume the JMeter binary is installed in `/usr/share/jmeter/bin/` however you can modify this in your example to something that suits your installation e.g.:


```ruby
...
end.run(path: 'C/Program Files/JMeter/bin/', gui: true)
```
